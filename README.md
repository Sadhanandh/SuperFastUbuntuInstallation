This is My super fast ubuntu reinstaller

Upgrades and Downgrades take all the human efforts possible in Ubuntu.

This scripts unzips and rightly make the new environment the same as old within few minutes.

The shortcuts are actually personal zipped files which exists in my External Drive

So ignore these files and replace these with zips of ur personal folders and files
